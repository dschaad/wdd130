      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>How do you choose between two similar things without trying each one? That's a problem among Minecraft mods I hope to alleviate. Minecraft is a popular video game and has a thriving modding community. Mods can make unique changes to a game for players to enjoy. Naturally, because there are so many mods out there, it's inevitable that some have overlapping features. Rather than forcing players to trial-and-error, I hope to showcase similar mods and compare their strengths and weaknesses so players can more easily choose the one more fit for them.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People familiar with video and computer games, specifically Minecraft, and have at least some knowledge of mods. Ages 10-30. Financial status is basically irrelevant, but primarily individuals who have enough free time to play computer games. People who enjoy video games such as Minecraft. People interested in mods but feel overwhelmed by the numerous options that on the surface may seem indistinguishable. People who want concise information about mods so they can easily pick ones that appeal to them and their playstyle. Primarily accessed through a computer or laptop.</p>

      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p>
        My goal is to focus on bigger mods that have a lot of content, as that’s where I tend to start when building modpacks or looking into adding mods to my single player games. I also want to be sure to pick mods that I feel accomplish the same or at least similar goals, whether that be adding technology and automation, to organization, farming utilities, or simply offering additional ways to explore playstyles. Even though a lot of my content could be argued as personal opinion, I aspire to be as genuine and fair as possible, giving mods equal pros and cons and appealing to the strengths, not just the weaknesses, of each.

      <h3>Tech-Mod Comparison: IC2 vs Thermal Expansion</h3>
      <p>
        Both Thermal Expansion and Industrial Craft 2 accomplish similar things, most notably adding machinery and automation within Minecraft. Anyone who’s played both can easily argue that Thermal Expansion is far more intuitive and requires less grinding for resources than IC2. However, IC2 dominates Thermal Expansion when it comes to power options, complexity, and even realism, as the mod utilizes things like voltages and transformers for power. Even their cables have energy loss rates, something that’s non-existent in most other tech mods, Thermal Expansion being no exception.

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <p>
        Why am I Doing This? I imagine these kinds of comparisons will help users develop a general idea of mods and have a more enjoyable experience playing with mods that fit their playstyle. I hope to appeal to the people who are happy not knowing everything there is to know about a mod and are simply looking for a general overview, as well as a way to compare mods they aren’t familiar with against mods they may have some experience or knowledge of. Personal Experiences: I have a lot of experience with mods, especially Minecraft mods. While there are guides and tutorials and spotlights for specific mods online, I always felt these overviews were either far too drawn out or overexplained unnecessarily. Also, I rarely saw these mod reviews given with any comparison to other mods that try to achieve the same end-goals. Site “Activities”: The main activities I anticipate visitors wanting to complete on my site are primarily reading brief overviews of similar mods, with optional more in-depth explanations available to those who want to know more than just the basics. I could also look into a sort of form that helps players determine their playstyle based on some general questions and then recommend mods that fit their unique specifications. I could also implement some universal ratings that could be applied to any mods; things like compatibility with other mods, complexity, how much grinding in required, how balanced the mod is compared to others of similar types, and so on. What You Need to Know: For the most part, the only information necessary for those using my site will be a general understanding of Minecraft as a game as well as mods and modding as options to change the behavior or content of video games. I could even bypass this need by including simple explanations of both, either on some sort of homepage or frequently asked questions.
