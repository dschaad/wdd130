                    <h3>Why Am I Doing This?</h3>
                    <p>I hope this site will help people develop a general idea of Minecraft mods and have a more enjoyable experience playing with mods that fit their playstyle. I hope to appeal to the people who are simply looking for a general overview of a mod.</p>

                    <h3>What Is My Experience with Minecraft Mods?</h3>
                    <p>I have a lot of experience with using mods, especially in Minecraft. While there are guides and tutorials for specific mods online, I always felt these overviews were either far too drawn out or unnecessarily overexplained. I felt I had to watch hours of explanations in order to decide whether or not I'd enjoy a mod, which didn't seem ideal.</p>

                    <h3>What Do I Need To Know?</h3>
                    <p>The only information necessary for those using my site will be a general understanding of Minecraft as a game. Also an understanding of mods as tools to change the behavior or content of video games.</p>
